Attempts to solve problems in [`rosalind.info`](http://rosalind.info) using Haskell


Directory structure:
  * [`src`](./src) contains common files
  * [`problems`](./src/problems) contains solution to problems. Files are named after `rosalind` problem id. 
  

These solutions need refactoring:
  * [`long`](./src/problems/long.hs)
  * [`full`](./src/problems/full.hs)
